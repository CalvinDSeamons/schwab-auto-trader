## Schwab Auto Trader

#### The following code is a framework for interfacing with Schwab's API interface for automatic trading and financial research. There are various versions of this code available on github. I am very hesitant on using someone elses code to link to my personal brokerage account so I wrote my own (The code is minimal, well commented, and hopefully easy to understand). Please use caution before using 3rd party software to trade, review this code before you use it.  I am not liable for any loses incured by using this software. Below are instructions on how to setup an account with schwab to use this software.

### Create Necessary Accounts. 
1) You must have a Charles Schwab account, this can be a Roth IRA, Induvidual Brokerage, or some other account. If not see: https://www.schwab.com/open-an-account\.
